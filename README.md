### About
Stratlas is a tool for rendering full-size maps from popular 2D Real-Time Strategy games to standalone image files. It aims for pixel-perfect accuracy and support for a wide range of games.

No copyrighted data is distributed with Stratlas - instead it is extracted at run-time from the game data files. This means you must (generally) own the game from which you wish to render maps.

Stratlas is released under the GNU GPL v3.
